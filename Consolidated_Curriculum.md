# ACCN-Umoja Robotics Team 7712 - Mechanical Curriculum

## Overview
This 7-day intensive mechanical curriculum is designed for high school students participating in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Each session is 4-5 hours long, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice in an interactive, student-mentor collaborative environment.

## Curriculum Goals
- Develop fundamental mechanical engineering skills for FRC competition
- Foster problem-solving and critical thinking abilities
- Build teamwork and communication skills
- Prepare students for real-world FRC challenges
- Create a foundation for advanced robotics concepts

## Structure
- **Duration**: 7 days (35 hours total)
- **Format**: Interactive workshops with hands-on activities
- **Approach**: Student-mentor collaborative learning
- **Assessment**: Project-based with peer evaluation

## Daily Sessions
1. **Day 1**: Introduction to FRC & Mechanical Fundamentals
2. **Day 2**: Design Process & CAD Fundamentals
3. **Day 3**: Drivetrain Systems & Power Transmission
4. **Day 4**: Mechanisms & Actuators
5. **Day 5**: Material Selection & Manufacturing
6. **Day 6**: Assembly & Integration
7. **Day 7**: Testing, Troubleshooting & Competition Prep

## Learning Outcomes
