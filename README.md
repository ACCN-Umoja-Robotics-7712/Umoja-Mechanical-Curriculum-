- Build teamwork and communication skills through collaborative design
- Master CAD software for professional robot design
- Prepare students for real-world FRC challenges
- Create a foundation for advanced robotics concepts

## Structure
- **Duration**: 7 weeks (35 hours total)
- **Schedule**: Fridays - Oct 25, Nov 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, Dec 6
- **Format**: Interactive workshops with hands-on activities
- **Approach**: Student-mentor collaborative learning with progressive skill building
- **Assessment**: Project-based with peer evaluation and portfolio development
