## Weekly Schedule

### Hour 1: Measurement Systems & Conversions (60 minutes)
**Format**: Interactive instruction with extensive hands-on practice

#### Activities:
1. **Units of Measurement Mastery** (25 min)
   **Critical Conversions** (from your curriculum documents):
   - **How many mm make a cm?** (10 mm = 1 cm)
   - **How many cm make an inch?** (2.54 cm = 1 inch)  
   - **How many mm make an inch?** (25.4 mm = 1 inch)

   **Why This Matters in FRC**:
   - Most FRC structural components use imperial measurements
   - Many motors and electronics use metric specifications
   - International suppliers may use different systems
   - Precision requires understanding both systems

   **Conversion Practice**:
   - Students work through real FRC scenarios
   - "If a motor shaft is 8mm diameter, what drill bit size do I need?" (5/16" = 7.9mm)
   - "Our robot must fit in 28" x 38" - what is this in centimeters?"
   - Use both calculation and conversion tables

2. **Measuring Tool Applications** (25 min)
   **Standard Distance Measurement** (from your curriculum):
   - **Tape Measure**: Long distances, flexible applications, general layout
