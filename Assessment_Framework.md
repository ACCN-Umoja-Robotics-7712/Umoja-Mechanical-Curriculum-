# Assessment and Evaluation Framework
**ACCN-Umoja Robotics Team 7712 - Mechanical Curriculum**

## Overview
This assessment framework provides multiple evaluation methods to measure student learning, skill development, and readiness for FRC competition. The assessments are designed to be formative (ongoing feedback) and summative (final evaluation) while maintaining the collaborative, hands-on spirit of the curriculum.
