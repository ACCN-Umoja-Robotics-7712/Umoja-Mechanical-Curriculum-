## Technical Mentoring Strategies

### Effective Questioning Techniques
Instead of giving direct answers, guide students to discover solutions:

**Replace "Do this..."** with **"What do you think would happen if...?"**
**Replace "That's wrong"** with **"What does your testing tell you?"**
**Replace "Here's how to fix it"** with **"What have you tried so far?"**

### Problem-Solving Guidance
**When Students Are Stuck:**
1. **Observe**: "Tell me what you're trying to do"
2. **Analyze**: "What have you tried already?"
3. **Hypothesize**: "What do you think might be causing the problem?"
4. **Test**: "How could we test that theory?"
5. **Iterate**: "What should we try next?"

### Building Student Confidence
- **Acknowledge Effort**: "I can see you're really thinking about this"
- **Highlight Progress**: "Look how much better this is than your first attempt"
- **Normalize Struggle**: "This is challenging - engineering problems usually are"
- **Connect to Experts**: "Real engineers deal with this same issue"

## Safety Leadership for Mentors

### Setting Safety Culture
- **Model Behavior**: Always follow safety procedures yourself
- **Explain Why**: Help students understand reasons behind safety rules
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Recognize good safety practices
- **Consistent Enforcement**: Apply safety rules fairly and consistently

### Handling Safety Violations
1. **Stop Activity**: Immediately halt unsafe behavior
2. **Address Privately**: Avoid embarrassing students publicly
3. **Explain Impact**: Help student understand potential consequences
4. **Retrain**: Provide additional instruction if needed
5. **Document**: Record serious violations for program improvement

### Emergency Leadership
- **Stay Calm**: Your response sets the tone for students
- **Take Charge**: Provide clear direction in emergency situations

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if a student gets injured?**
A: Follow the established emergency procedures. Provide appropriate first aid, notify school administration and parents, and document the incident. Remember that minor scrapes and cuts are part of hands-on learning, but take all injuries seriously.

**Q: What if students aren't getting along?**
A: Address conflicts quickly and privately. Help students understand different working styles and find ways to contribute. Consider team changes if necessary, but try to work through differences first.

**Q: What if we fall behind schedule?**
A: Focus on key learning objectives and safety. Skip nice-to-have activities and prioritize hands-on experience. Better to do fewer things well than rush through everything.

**Q: What if students want to take home their projects?**
A: Plan for this in advance. Some items can go home, others need to stay for safety or cost reasons. Be clear about expectations from the beginning.

**Q: What if students are bored or find activities too easy?**
A: Have extension activities ready. Advanced students can help teach others, tackle more complex challenges, or work on optimization problems.

**Q: What if students are struggling with basic concepts?**
A: Slow down and provide more scaffolding. Use peer mentoring and break complex tasks into smaller steps. Focus on hands-on understanding over theoretical knowledge.
